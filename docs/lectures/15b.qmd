# Statistics

## Traditional Statistics

Traditional Statistics methods can conducted using either linear or generalized linear models.

## What is Statistics? 

It is the study of variation and randomness!


## What's the goal of Statistics?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 2em; color: red;"}
**INFERENCE**
:::

::: fragment
Use our sample data to understand the larger population.
:::

::: fragment
The data will tell us how the population generally behaves.
:::

::: fragment
The data will guide us in the differences in units.
:::

::: fragment
Data will tell us if there is a signal or just noise.
:::

## Final Thoughts

::: fragment
When conducting a study, literature review and study design are as equally important as statistics.
:::

::: fragment
If you don't see variability in the data, something is wrong.
:::

::: fragment
Focus on consistency in the methodology, not consistency in data.
:::

::: fragment
Understand that you can be wrong, and that is okay.
:::

::: fragment
Don't let data influence the methodology during a study/experiment.
