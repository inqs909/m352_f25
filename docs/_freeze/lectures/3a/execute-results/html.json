The Probability of a random variable Y can be expressed as $P(Y=y)$ for all values of $y$.\n\n## Cumulative Density Function\n\nThe cumulative distribution function provides the $P(Y\\leq y)$ for a random variable $Y$.\n\n# Bernoulli Distribution\n\n## Bernoulli Distribution\n\nA Bernoulli distribution is probability of having a success out of two outcomes. In essence, a coin flip with probability of success $p$.\n\n# Binomial Distribution\n\n\n## Binomial Distribution\n\nFor a given sample, the number of successes represents a binomial distribution. Binary outcomes are represented with with a Bernoulli experiment. The sum of Bernoulli experiments represents the binomial distribution. \n\n\n## Binomial Distribution\n\nFor a binomial experiment, the following must be satisfied:\n\n::: fragment\n-   There is a fixed $n$ trials\n\n-   The there are two outcomes for each trial\n\n-   The probability of success ($p$) is constant for each trial\n\n-   The trials are independent of each other\n:::\n\n## PMF\n\n## Example\n\nThe probability of a planted seed to germinate is 0.3. An arborist decides to plant 8 seeds in the community. What is the probability that 3 to 5 seeds will germinate?\n\n## Example\n\nThe probability of a planted seed to germinate is 0.6. An arborist decides to plant 8 seeds in the community. What is the probability that at least 1 seed germinates?\n\n## Example\n\nThe probability of a planted seed to germinate is 0.8. An arborist decides to plant 6 seeds in the community. What is the probability that an even number of seed will germinate?\n\n# Poisson Distribution\n\n## Poisson Distribution\n\nThe poisson distribution describes an experiment that measures that occurrence of an event at specific point and/or time period.\n\n## PMF\n\n## Example\n\nThe number of industrial accidents at a particular manufacturing plant is found to be an average of 1 accident per month. In the previous month, there were 3 accidents. What is the probability of observing 3 or more accidents in a given month?\n\n## Example\n\nThe number of industrial accidents at a particular manufacturing plant is found to be an average of 8 accidents per year. What is the probability of observing 15 or more accidents in a given year?\n\n# Geometric Distribution\n\n## Geometric Distribution\n\nA geometric distribution models the number of Bernoulli trials until the first success (or failure).\n\n## PMF\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose 30% of the applicants for a certain industrial job possess the necessary skills. What is the probability that the first applicant with the necessary skills is found on the 5th interview.\n\n# Negative Binomial Distribution\n\n## Negative Binomial Distribution\n\nA negative binomial distribution models the number of successful Bernoulli trials until the $r$th failure.\n\n## PMF\n\n## Example\n\nTen percent of engines manufactured on an assembly line are defective. If engines are randomly selected one at a time and tested, what is the probability that third nondefective engine is found on the 4th trial.",
