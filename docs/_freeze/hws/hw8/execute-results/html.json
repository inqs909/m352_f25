The dataset consists of 344 penguin observations with 8 variables, including species, sex, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and several other measurements.\n\nResearchers are interested if the there is a significant relationship between `body_mass_g` (body mass measured in grams) and a set of predictors: `flipper_length_mm` (measured in mm), `bill_length_mm` (measured in mm), and `bill_depth_mm` (measured in mm). They decide to run a multiple linear regression to describe the relationship between the variables. The output is provided below:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm + bill_length_mm + \n    bill_depth_mm)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-1051.37  -284.50   -20.37   241.03  1283.51 \n\nCoefficients:\n                   Estimate Std.

What is the predicted body mass of a penguin with a flipper length of 213, bill length of 43, and bill depth of 17.\n\n## Problem 2\n\nIn logistic regression, the odds ratio is a measure of the strength of the relationship between the predictor variables and the dependent variable. It represents the ratio of the odds of the dependent variable for two different values of the predictor variable, holding all other variables constant.\n\nTo interpret the odds ratio, we first need to understand what odds are. Odds are a way of expressing the probability of an event occurring as a ratio of the number of times the event occurs to the number of times it does not occur. For example, if a coin has a 50% chance of landing heads, the odds of it landing heads are 1:1 or 1/1.\n\nTo compute the odds ratio:\n\n1.  Determine the beta coefficient value for the predictor variable of interest from the logistic regression model output.\n2.  Calculate the exponential function of the beta coefficient value. This can be done using a scientific calculator or software like R or Python.\n3.  For example, if the beta coefficient value is 0.8, the exponential function would be e\\^0.8 = 2.2255.\n4.  Interpret the resulting value as the odds ratio. The odds ratio represents the change in the odds of the outcome variable for a one-unit increase in the predictor variable.\n5.  For example, if the odds ratio is 2.2255, it means that for every one-unit increase in the predictor variable, the odds of the outcome variable occurring are 2.2255 times higher.\n6.  Consider the confidence interval and the p-value associated with the odds ratio. The confidence interval provides a range of values within which the true odds ratio is likely to lie with a certain level of certainty. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates that the odds ratio is statistically significant.\n\nResearchers are interested in whether the probability of being admitted to graduate school is affected by an individual's GRE and GPA score. They fit a Logistic regression modeling the probability of being accepted.

They fit a Poisson regression on the number of awards and using the predictors prog (reference=General) and math in the model.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = num_awards ~ prog + math, family = \"poisson\", data = p)\n\nCoefficients:\n               Estimate Std.
