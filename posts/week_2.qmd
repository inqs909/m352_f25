## Important Concepts

#### Experiment

A process that yields an outcome randomly.

#### Sample Space

The *sample space* (S) is all the possible outcomes from an experiment.

#### Event

An *event* is a collection of outcomes of an experiment that is any subset of the sample space S (including S).

#### Random Variable

A *random variable* (rv) is a function that maps a sample space to the real numbers. A rv is denoted by a capital letter. The observed value is denoted with a lower-case letter.

### Probability (Cumulative) Distribution Function

The *cumulative distribution function* of a random variable $X$, expressed as $F_X(x)$, is defined as

$$
F_X(x) = P(X\leq x),
$$

providing the probability of observing $x$ or lower.

#### Probability Mass Function (Categorical Variable[^1])

[^1]: We will define this later on in the semester.

The *probability mass function* of a random variable, expressed as $f_X(x)$, is expressed as

$$
f_X(x)=P(X=x),
$$

providing the probability of observing $x$.

### Second Lecture

#### **Disjoint Events**

Two events **A** and **B** are considered disjoint if $P(A\cap B)=0$. In general terms, only one event can occur, not both.

#### Conditional Probability

Let there be 2 events **A** and **B**. Given that **B** has occurred, what is the probability that **A** occurs? The conditional probability requires there to be at least 2 events and one event must have occurred. Additionally, the events cannot be disjoint. Conditional probabilities are denoted as \$P(A\|B)\$, the probability of **A** given **B** has occurred.

-   $P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}$

#### Independent Events

Events **A** and **B** are considered independent if $P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)$. In other words, The occurrence of one event will not affect the occurrence of the other event.

#### Law of Total Probability

The law of total probability allows you to compute the probability of an event **A** given that the sets {$B_1$, ..., $B_n$} partitions event **A**. The law of total probability is given as

$$
P(A) = \sum^n_{i=1}P(A\cap B_i) = \sum^n_{i=1}P(A|B_i)P(B_i)
$$

#### Baye's Theorem

Baye's theorem computes the probability of an event $B_i$ given event **A**

$$
P(B_i|A) = \frac{P(A\cap B_i)}{P(A)}=\frac{P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}{\sum^n_{i=1}P(A|B_i)P(B_i)}
$$
