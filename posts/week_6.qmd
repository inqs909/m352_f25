## Important Concepts

### First Lecture

#### Moments

The $k$th moment is defined as the expectation of the random variable, raised to the $k$th power, defined as $E(X^k)$.

#### Moment Generating Functions

The moment generating functions is used to obtain the $k$th moment. The mgf is defined as

$$
m(c) = E(e^{tX})
$$

The $k$th moment can be obtained by taking the $k$th derivative of the mgf, with respect to $c$, and setting $c$ equal to 0:

$$
E(X^k)=\frac{d^km(c)}{dc}\Bigg|_{c=0}
$$

#### MGF Properties

##### Linearity

Let $X$ follow a distribution $f$, with the an MGF $M_X(t)$, the MGF of $Y=aX+b$ is given as

$$
M_Y(t) = e^{tb}M_X(at)
$$

Let $X$ and $Y$ be two random variables with MGFs $M_X(t)$ and $M_Y(t)$, respectively, and are independent. The MGF of $U=X-Y$

$$
M_U(t) = M_X(t)M_Y(-t)
$$

##### Uniqueness

Let $X$ and $Y$ have the following distributions $F_X(x)$ and $F_Y(y)$ and MGFs $M_X(t)$ and $M_Y(t)$, respectively. $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution $F_X(x)=F_Y(y)$ if and only if $M_X(t)=M_Y(t)$.
