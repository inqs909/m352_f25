-   Define independent events

-   Law of Total Probability

-   Baye's Theorem

# Disjoint Events

## Disjoint Events

Two events **A** and **B** are considered disjoint if $\Pr(A\cap B)=0$. In general terms, only one event can occur, not both.


# Conditional Probability

## Conditional Probability

Let there be 2 events **A** and **B**. Given that **B** has occurred, what is the probability that **A** occurs? The conditional probability requires there to be at least 2 events and one event must have occurred. Additionally, the events cannot be disjoint. Conditional probabilities are denoted as $\Pr(A|B)$, the probability of **A** given **B** has occurred.

$$
\Pr(A|B)=\frac{\Pr(A\cap B)}{\Pr(B)}
$$



## Example 1: Drawing Cards

We have a standard deck of 52 cards.  
Letâ€™s find the probability of drawing an **ace**, given that the card is a **spade**.


## Example 2: Rolling Dice

Two fair dice are rolled.  
Find the probability that the sum is **10**, given that the first die shows a **6**.


## Example 3: Medical Test

A certain disease affects 1% of the population.  
A test correctly identifies the disease 95% of the time, but has a 5% false-positive rate.  
Find the probability that someone has the disease given a **positive test result**.

## Example 4: Eye Glasses

|               |                  |     |
|---------------|------------------|-----|
|               | Uses Eye Glasses |     |
| Needs Glasses | Yes              | No  |
| Yes           | 44               | 14  |
| No            | 2                | 40  |

-   Find the probability of needing glasses

-   Find the probability of not using glasses

-   Find the probability of not using glasses and needing glasses

-   Find the probability of not using glasses, given they need glasses


# Law of Total Probability

## Law of Total Probability

The law of total probability allows you to compute the probability of an event **A** given that the sets {$B_1$, ... , $B_n$} partitions event **A**. The law of total probability is given as

$$
\Pr(A)= \sum^n_{i=1}\Pr(A\cap B_i)
$$

::: fragment
$$
\Pr(A)=\sum^n_{i=1}\Pr(A|B_i)\Pr(B_i)
$$


## Diagrams

## Example 1: Weather and Rain Forecast

Suppose the weather forecast is either **Sunny (S)** or **Cloudy (C)**.

- $P(S) = 0.7$, $P(C) = 0.3$  
- Probability of rain given sunny: $P(R \mid S) = 0.1$  
- Probability of rain given cloudy: $P(R \mid C) = 0.5$  

What is the probability of rain?


## Example 2: Disease

The probability of an individual having a disease, given that they test positive for the disease, is 0.82. The probability of an individual having a disease, given they tested negative, is 0.14. The probability of testing positive is 0.6. What is the prevalence of a disease (probability of having a disease)?

# Independent Events

## Independent Events

Events **A** and **B** are considered independent if $\Pr(A\cap B)=\Pr(A)\Pr(B)$. In other words, The occurrence of one event will not have an effect on the occurrence of the other event.

## Example 1: Eye Glasses

|               | Uses Eye Glasses |     |
|---------------|------------------|-----|
| Needs Glasses | Yes              | No  |
| Yes           | 44               | 14  |
| No            | 2                | 40  |

## Example 2: Drawing with Replacement

A jar contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls (8 total).  
We draw **two balls with replacement**.

## Example 3: Drawing without Replacement

A jar contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls (8 total).  
We draw **two balls with replacement**.



# Baye's Theorem

## Baye's Theorem

Baye's theorem computes the probability of an event $B_i$ given event **A**

$$
\Pr(B_i|A) = \frac{\Pr(A\cap B_i)}{\Pr(A)}=\frac{\Pr(A|B_i)\Pr(B_i)}{\sum^n_{i=1}\Pr(A|B_i)\Pr(B_i)}
$$

## Example 1: Factory Machines

A factory has three machines producing items:

- Machine A produces 40% of items, with a defect rate of 2%.  
- Machine B produces 35% of items, with a defect rate of 3%.  
- Machine C produces 25% of items, with a defect rate of 5%.  

If an item is defective, what is the probability it came from Machine C?


## Example 2: Email Spam Filtering

Suppose 80% of emails are legitimate, 20% are spam. A keyword appears in 60% of spam emails but in only 5% of legitimate emails.  If an email contains the keyword, what is the probability it is spam?

## Example 3: Disease

The probability of an having a disease, given that they test positive for the disease, is 0.82. The probability of and individual having a disease, given they tested negative, is 0.14. The probability of testing positive is 0.6. What is the probability of resulting in a false negative?
