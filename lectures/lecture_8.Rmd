## Histograms

A histogram is used to plot the frequency of values of a certain variable. For example, the `mtcars` data set contains the `mpg` variable with information on different cars' miles per gallon. If we want to get an idea of the distribution of the mile per gallon, we can visualize it using the `hist` function in R:

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

We can see from the plot that the majority of cars has an mpg between 15-20.

## Density Plots

If we are more interested in creating a smooth curve and density (relative frequency), we can use a density plot

```{r}
plot(density(mtcars$mpg))
```
